Sometimes it would be nice to treat a PDF as a text buffer, so you can do
fancier searches etc. than =pdf-tools= would allow for. Other times, you may be
limited to a terminal (e.g. Emacs over ssh), and want to peek at a PDF.

In both cases, =pdftotext= can be rather helpful. This package just provides a
mode that makes use of it. You'll also need =fmt= for line re-wrapping.
